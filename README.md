# GitHub user activity script

This script uses the GitHub RestApi to fetch all the recent user activity and display it in the CLI.

To use the script first do ``` pip install request ```, after that do ``` python {file_path} {user_name} ```

# What i want to do in the future 

I want to optimize the code so it doesn't use if/elif statements to determine what message to be displayed.
